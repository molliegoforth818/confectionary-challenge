# Welcome to the Confectionery

You have been tasked to build an app that will allow the employees of the confectionery to manage the different flavors and varieties of ice creams that the shop carries

## Project Setup

* Clone down the repo and `cd` into it

* Change this from a git repo to a regular directory:
  * `rm -rf .git`

* Create a new repository on Github and make your first commit with this boilerplate code:
  * Create a brand new repository under your account on Github
  * `git init`
  * `git add .`
  * `git commit -m "First commit with boilerplate code"`
  * `git remote add origin your-new-repos-ssh-remote-url`
  * `git push -u origin master`

* Create your OSX/Linux OS virtual environment in Terminal:

  * `python -m venv confectioneryenv`
  * `source ./confectioneryenv/bin/activate`

* Install the app's dependencies:

  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* All your models and migrations have already been created, so ahead and run migrations:

  * `python manage.py migrate`

* Create a superuser for your local version of the app:

  * `python manage.py createsuperuser`

* Populate your database with initial data from fixtures files: (_NOTE: every time you run this it will remove existing data and repopulate the tables_)

  * `python manage.py loaddata flavors`
  * `python manage.py loaddata varieties`
  * `python manage.py loaddata variety_flavors`

* Make a copy of `icecreamapp/views/connection.py.example` and remove the `.example` extension and change the path to the database 

* Fire up your dev server and get to work!

  * `python manage.py runserver`


## Requirements

You need to meet the following requirements in the order they are listed since they build on each other. After each requirement has been met, please make sure you make a commit with a detailed commit message explaining what feature has been completed. You **do not** need to worry about authentication for this application.

1. When a user navigates to the root URL of the application (`/`), they should see a list of all the varieties of ice cream in alphabetical order.

1. Above the list of ice cream varieties, provide a link that presents the user with a form to add a new variety by providing the name and country of origin. When the form is submitted, the user should be directed to `/` and should see the newly added variety in the list.

1. Add a link to view the details of each ice cream variety for every item on the list of varieties. When the user clicks on this link, they should see the name of the variety of ice cream, the country of origin, the names of the many flavors that are available in that variety and the possible toppings for each combination.

1. Add a DELETE button next to each flavor listed on the details page for a ice cream variety. When the user clicks this button, the flavor should be removed from that variety. **This action should not delete the flavor itself!**

1. Add an EDIT button at the bottom of the ice cream variety details page. When the user clicks on the button, they should be presented with a form that lets them edit only the country of origin of the ice cream variety.
